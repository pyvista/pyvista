Unstructured Grid with Polyhedra
--------------------------------

This example shows how to build a simple :class:`pyvista.UnstructuredGrid`
using polyhedra. We will be using VTK types to determine which type of cells we
are building.

First, we import the required libraries.

# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#    been done here to create isolated cells for this example.

# Cell connectivity
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Connectivity describes the indices of the points to compose each cell. The
# first item in each cell's connectivity is the number of items the cell will
# have. For example, a quad cell is composed of points ``[0, 1, 2, 3]`` and
# totaling 4 points, therefore ``[4, 0, 1, 2, 3]`` describes its connectivity.
#
# .. note::
#    This example uses lists for simplicity, but internally PyVista converts
#    these lists to a :class:`numpy.ndarray` with ``dtype=pyvista.ID_TYPE`` and
#    passes it to VTK.
#
# The same approach can be applied to all the other cell types.

# Polyhedron connectivity array
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# The connectivity array of polyhedra is defined differently from the rest of the cell
# types. For polyhedra, we need to set the faces with the following format:
#
# ``[NItems, NFaces, Face0NPoints, Face0Point0, Face0Point1..., Face0PointN-1, Face1NPoints, ...]``
#
# Where:
#
# - ``NItems`` refers to the total number of items in the list needed to
#   describe the polyhedron.
# - ``NFaces`` is the number of faces the polyhedron will have.
# - ``Face0NPoints`` is the number of points the first face will have.
# - ``Face0Point0...Face0PointN-1`` are each of the points that describe ``face0``.
#
# In ``polyhedron_connectivity``, the first item is ``NFaces``. ``NItems`` is
# added to ``polyhedron``.

    # NItems will go here
