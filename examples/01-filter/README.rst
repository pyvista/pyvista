Filtering
---------

These examples show case various mesh analysis and filtering routines present
in the :ref:`filters` module. Explore these demos to perform tasks such as:

* Slicing and cutting meshes
* Computing mesh properties like volume, area, and surface normals
* Mesh decimation
* Extract regions of one mesh using another mesh's surface
* Ray tracing through surface meshes
* Resampling and interpolating scalar/vector values across meshes
* Integrating a vector field to generate streamlines
* Smoothing surfaces
