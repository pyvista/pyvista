Boolean Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Perform boolean operations with closed (manifold) surfaces.

Boolean/topological operations (intersect, union, difference) methods
are implemented for :class:`pyvista.PolyData` mesh types only and are
accessible directly from any :class:`pyvista.PolyData` mesh. Check out
:class:`pyvista.PolyDataFilters` and take a look at the following
filters:

* :func:`pyvista.PolyDataFilters.boolean_difference`
* :func:`pyvista.PolyDataFilters.boolean_union`
* :func:`pyvista.PolyDataFilters.boolean_intersection`

Essentially, boolean union, difference, and intersection are all the
same operation. Just different parts of the objects are kept at the
end.

The ``-`` operator can be used between any two :class:`pyvista.PolyData`
meshes in PyVista to cut the first mesh by the second.  These meshes
must be all triangle meshes, which you can check with
:attr:`pyvista.PolyData.is_all_triangles`.

.. note::
   For merging, the ``+`` operator can be used between any two meshes
   in PyVista which simply calls the ``.merge()`` filter to combine
   any two meshes.  This is different from the operator ``|`` in PyVista
   which simply calls the ``boolean_union`` filter as it simply superimposes
   the two meshes without performing additional calculations on the result.
   The ``&`` operator in PyVista simply calls the ``boolean_intersection``.

.. warning::
   If your boolean operations don't react the way you think they
   should (i.e. the wrong parts disappear), one of your meshes
   probably has its normals pointing inward. Use
   :func:`pyvista.PolyDataFilters.plot_normals` to visualize the normals.

# ++++++++++++++++++++

# Perform a boolean intersection of ``A`` and ``B`` using the

# Behavior due to flipped faces
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Note that these boolean filters behave differently depending on the
# orientation of the faces. This is because the orientation determines
# which parts are considered to be the "outside" or the "inside" portion
# of the mesh. This example uses :meth:`~pyvista.PolyDataFilters.flip_faces`
# to flip the faces.
#
# Boolean difference with both cube and sphere faces oriented
# outward.  This is the "normal" behavior.
