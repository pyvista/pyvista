Plotting
--------

These examples show case many of the possibilities for altering how you display
spatial data. Explore these examples to learn how to leverage our powerful 3D
plotting routines to perform tasks like:

* Color mapping scalar values with ``matplotlib`` colormaps
* Creating animations as GIFs or movie files
* Showing the edges and nodes of different mesh types
* Use sophisticated lighting techniques like smooth shading or Eye Dome Lighting
* Glyph a vector or scalar field on a mesh (place/orient a mesh on another mesh's nodes and scale/orient based on data values)
* Label points in 3D space along side your meshes
* Creating side-by-side comparisons
* Making a dataset transparent or using a scalar value to map opacity
* Adding textures/images draped over a mesh (texture mapping)
* Rendering a depth image
