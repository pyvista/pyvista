.. _add_example_example:

Adding a New Gallery Example
----------------------------
This example demonstrates how to add a new PyVista `Sphinx Gallery
<https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/>`_ example as well as being a template that
can be used in their creation.

Each example should have a reference tag/key in the form:

``.. _<example-name>_example:``

The ``.. _`` is necessary. Everything that follows is your reference tag, which
can potentially be used within a docstring. As convention, we keep all
references all in ``snake_case``.

This section should give a brief overview of what the example is about and/or
demonstrates.  The title should be changed to reflect the topic your example
covers.

New examples should be added as python scripts to:

``examples/<index>-<directory-name>/<some-example>.py``

.. note::
   Avoid creating new directories unless absolutely necessary.If you *must*
   create a new folder, make sure to add a ``README.txt`` containing a
   reference, a title and a single sentence description of the folder.
   Otherwise the new folder will be ignored by Sphinx.

Example file names should be hyphen separated snake case:

``some-example.py``

After this preamble is complete, the first code block begins. This is where you
typically set up your imports.

###############################################################################
# Section Title
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Code blocks can be broken up with text "sections" which are interpreted as
# restructured text.
#
# This will also be translated into a markdown cell in the generated jupyter
# notebook or the HTML page.
#
# Sections can contain any information you may have regarding the example
# such as step-by-step comments or notes regarding motivations etc.
#
# As in Jupyter notebooks, if a statement is unassigned at the end of a code
# block, output will be generated and printed to the screen according to its
# ``__repr__`` method.  Otherwise, you can use ``print()`` to output text.

# Create a dataset and exercise it's repr method
dataset = pv.Sphere()
dataset


###############################################################################
# Plots and images
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# If you use anything that outputs an image (for example,
# :func:`pyvista.Plotter.show`) the resulting image will be rendered within the
# output HTML.
#
# .. note::
#    Unless ``sphinx_gallery_thumbnail_number = <int>`` is included at the top
#    of the example script, first figure (this one) will be used for the
#    gallery thumbnail image.
#
#    Also note that this image number uses one based indexing.

dataset.plot(text='Example Figure')


###############################################################################
# Caveat - Plotter must be within One Cell
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# It's not possible for a single :class:`pyvista.Plotter` object across
# multiple cells because these are closed out automatically at the end of a
# cell.
#
# Here we just exercise the :class:`pyvista.Actor` ``repr`` for demonstrating
# why you might want to instantiate a plotter without showing it in the same
# cell.

pl = pv.Plotter()
actor = pl.add_mesh(dataset)
actor


###############################################################################
# This Cell Cannot Run the Plotter
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# The plotter will already be closed by ``sphinx_gallery``.

# This cannot be run here because the plotter is already closed and would raise
# an error:
# >>> pl.show()

# You can, however, close out the plotter or access other attributes.
pl.close()


###############################################################################
# Animations
# ~~~~~~~~~~
# You can even create animations, and while there is a full example in
# :ref:`movie_example`, this cell explains how you can create an animation
# within a single cell.
#
# Here, we explode a simple sphere.

pl = pv.Plotter(off_screen=True)

# optimize for size
pl.open_gif('example_movie.gif', palettesize=16)

sphere = pv.Sphere(theta_resolution=10, phi_resolution=10)

# Add initial mesh to setup the camera
actor = pl.add_mesh(sphere)
pl.background_color = 'w'

# clear and overwrite the mesh on each frame
n_frames = 20
for i in range(n_frames):
    exploded = sphere.explode(factor=i / (n_frames * 2)).extract_surface()
    actor.mapper.dataset.copy_from(exploded)
    pl.camera.reset_clipping_range()
    pl.write_frame()  # Write this frame

# Be sure to close the plotter when finished
pl.close()


###############################################################################
# Adding Example Files
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# PyVista has a variety of example files all stored at `pyvista/vtk_data
# <https://github.com/pyvista/vtk-data>`_, and you can add the file by
# following the directions there.
#
# Under the hood, PyVista uses `pooch <https://github.com/fatiando/pooch>`_,
# and you can easily access any files added with
# :func:`pyvista.examples.downloads.download_file`.

filename = examples.download_file('bunny.ply')
filename


###############################################################################
# Adding a Wrapped Example
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# While it's possible to simply download a file and then read it in, it's
# better for you to write a wrapped ``download_<example-dataset>()`` within
# ``/pyvista/examples/downloads.py``. For example :func:`download_bunny()
# <pyvista.examples.downloads.download_bunny>` downloads and reads with
# :func:`pyvista.read`.
#
# If you intend on adding an example file, you should add a new function in
# ``downloads.py`` to make it easy for users to add example files.

dataset = examples.download_bunny()
dataset


# Making a Pull Request
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Once your example is complete and you've verified it builds locally, you can
# make a pull request (PR).
#
# Branches containing examples should be prefixed with `docs/` as per the branch
# naming conventions found in out `Contributing Guidelines
# <https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_.
#
# .. note::
#    You only need to create the Python source example (``*.py``).  The jupyter
#    notebook and the example HTML will be auto-generated via `sphinx-gallery
#    <https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/>`_.
