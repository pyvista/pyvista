        pr-message: 'üöÄ Thanks for opening your first pull request in PyVista! üöÄ\nPlease make sure you read (skim üòâ) our [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\nA few things to keep in mind:\n\n- Remember to run the tests locally to make debugging issues easier.\n- If you need help writing tests, take a look at the existing ones for inspiration. If you don not know where to start, let `@pyvista/developers` know and we will walk you through it.\n- All new features should be documented. It helps to write the docstrings for your functions/classes before writing the code. This will help you think about your code design and results in better code.\n- No matter what, we are really grateful that you put in the effort to open this PR! ‚≠ê'
