This section contains resources to expand the usage of PyVista beyond
just running it from a Python console or IDE.  For example, you can
package PyVista in a docker image and build VTK with EGL to enable
rich headless plotting on remote servers.  You can also package
PyVista using ``pyinstaller`` to be used within a standalone
application.  You could even make a basic web application using
``flask``.

See the :ref:`ref_developer_notes` section for details on contributing
and how you can help develop PyVista.
