Charts
------
Charts API reference. These dedicated classes can be used to embed
charts in plotting windows. Note that full charts functionality
requires a VTK version of at least 9.2. Most components work fine
in older versions though.

Unusable features in older VTK versions:

   - Background colors and borders are not supported or erroneous.
   - ``ChartBox`` and ``ChartPie`` cannot have a custom geometry and
     fill the entire scene by default.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: _autosummary

   ChartBox
   ChartPie
   ChartMPL


To customize these charts, extra plot and utility classes are
available in the ``charts`` module. Note that users should
typically not instantiate these classes themselves, but rather
use the dedicated methods and properties from the chart
classes above.
