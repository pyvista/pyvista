Gridded Data
============

Gridded datasets in PyVista are datasets with topologically regular
point spacing.  These are less flexible than :ref:`point_sets_api`,
but are much more memory efficient as they can be described with a
handful of parameters rather than having to explicitly describe the
points and geometry of the dataset.

PyVista gridded data is composed of the
:class:`pyvista.RectilinearGrid` and :class:`pyvista.UniformGrid`
classes.  These classes inherit from the `vtkRectilinearGrid`_ and
`vtkImageData`_ classes and are commonly used to model images or
volumetric data.

A :class:`pyvista.RectilinearGrid` is used for modeling datasets with
regular variable spacing in the three coordinate directions.

.. pyvista-plot::
   :include-source: False

   from pyvista import demos
   demos.plot_datasets('RectilinearGrid')


A :class:`pyvista.UniformGrid` is used for modeling datasets with
regular uniform spacing in the three coordinate directions.

.. pyvista-plot::
   :include-source: False

   from pyvista import demos
   demos.plot_datasets('UniformGrid')


**Class Descriptions**

The following table describes PyVista's grid set classes.  These
classes inherit all methods from their corresponding VTK
`vtkRectilinearGrid`_ and `vtkImageData`_ superclasses.
