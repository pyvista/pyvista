Composite Datasets
==================

The :class:`pyvista.MultiBlock` class is a composite class to hold many
data sets which can be iterated over. ``MultiBlock`` behaves mostly like
a list, but has some dictionary-like features.

List-like Features
------------------

Create empty composite dataset

.. jupyter-execute::
   :hide-code:

   # must have this here as our global backend may not be static
   import pyvista
   pyvista.set_plot_theme('document')
   pyvista.set_jupyter_backend('pythreejs')
   pyvista.global_theme.window_size = [600, 400]
   pyvista.global_theme.axes.show = False
   pyvista.global_theme.anti_aliasing = 'fxaa'
   pyvista.global_theme.show_scalar_bar = False

.. jupyter-execute::

   import pyvista as pv
   from pyvista import examples
   blocks = pv.MultiBlock()
   blocks

Add some data to the collection.

.. jupyter-execute::

   blocks.append(pv.Sphere())
   blocks.append(pv.Cube(center=(0, 0, -1)))

Plotting the ``MultiBlock`` plots all the meshes contained by it.

.. jupyter-execute::

   blocks.plot(smooth_shading=True)

``MultiBlock`` is list-like, so individual blocks can be accessed via
indices.

.. jupyter-execute::

   blocks[0]  # Sphere

The length of the block can be accessed through :func:`len`

.. jupyter-execute::

   len(blocks)

or through the ``n_blocks`` attribute

.. jupyter-execute::

   blocks.n_blocks

More specifically, ``MultiBlock`` is a :class:`collections.abc.MutableSequence`
and supports operations such as append, pop, insert, etc. Some of these operations
allow optional names to be provided for the dictionary like usage.

.. jupyter-execute::

   blocks.append(pv.Cone(), name="cone")
   cone = blocks.pop(-1)  # Pops Cone
   blocks.reverse()

``MultiBlock`` also supports slicing for getting or setting blocks.

.. jupyter-execute::

   blocks[0:2]  # The Sphere and Cube objects in a new ``MultiBlock``


Dictionary-like Features
------------------------


``MultiBlock`` also has some dictionary features.  We can set the name
of the blocks, and then access them 

.. jupyter-execute::

   blocks = pv.MultiBlock([pv.Sphere(), pv.Cube()])
   blocks.set_block_name(0, "sphere")
   blocks.set_block_name(1, "cube")
   blocks["sphere"]  # Sphere

It is important to note that ``MultiBlock`` is not a dictionary and does
not enforce unique keys.  Keys can also be ``None``.  Extra care must be
taken to avoid problems using the dictionary-like features.

PyVista tries to keep the keys ordered correctly when doing list operations.

.. jupyter-execute::

   blocks.reverse()
   blocks.keys()

The dictionary like features are useful when reading in data from a file.  The
keys are often more understandable to access the data than the index.
:func:`pyvista.examples.download_cavity()
<pyvista.examples.downloads.download_cavity>` is an OpenFoam dataset with a nested
``MultiBlock`` structure.  There are two entries in the top-level object

.. jupyter-execute::

   data = examples.download_cavity()
   data.keys()

``"internalMesh"`` is a :class:`pyvista.UnstructuredGrid`.

.. jupyter-execute::

   data["internalMesh"]

``"boundary"`` is another :class:`pyvista.MultiBlock`.

.. jupyter-execute::

   data["boundary"]

Using the dictionary like features of :class:`pyvista.MultiBlock` allow for easier
inspection and use of the data coming from an outside source.  The names of each key
correspond to human understable portions of the dataset.

.. jupyter-execute::

   data["boundary"].keys()

Examples using this class:

* :ref:`slice_example`
* :ref:`volumetric_example`
* :ref:`depth_peeling_example`


MultiBlock API Reference
------------------------
The :class:`pyvista.MultiBlock` class holds attributes that
are *common* to all spatially referenced datasets in PyVista.  This
base class is analogous to VTK's `vtk.vtkMultiBlockDataSet`_ class.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: _autosummary
