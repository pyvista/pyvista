# pyvista-docs

A place where we automatically deploy the PyVista documentation.

This repository is automatically edited by our army of robots on the
Azure CI service. Changes to the documentation should not be made
here but rather in the [`PyVista`](https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista)
repository.

If you have any questions about this repository, feel free to ping
[@banesullivan](https://github.com/banesullivan) as he originally
implemented this hosting service for the PyVista documentation.
