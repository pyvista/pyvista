Named Colormaps
===============

Named colormaps supported by plotting-related classes such as
:class:`~pyvista.Plotter`.

The colormaps on this page come from various sources, and include:

- :bdg-secondary:`matplotlib` - colormaps from
  `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/colors/colormaps.html>`_.
- :bdg-success:`colorcet` - colormaps from
  `colorcet <https://colorcet.holoviz.org>`_.
- :bdg-primary:`cmocean` - colormaps from
  `cmocean <https://matplotlib.org/cmocean/>`_.

.. note::

    Some colormap names are duplicated between packages (e.g. ``'rainbow'``).
    If installed, colormaps from ``colorcet`` have priority.
