.. _trame_api:

Trame
-----
The PyVista ``pyvista.trame`` module allows users to access the `Trame
<https://kitware.github.io/trame/index.html>`_ widget from PyVista to create
web-based 3D visualizations. This allows you to access the VTK pipeline using
the PyVista API so you can pair PyVista and Trame so that PyVista plotters can
be used in a web context with both server and client-side rendering.

For the full user guide, see :ref:`trame_jupyter`.


.. warning::
   We are having an issue with Sphinx and numpydoc documenting this module
   because it is not in the top level namespace of the PyVista package.
   We will fix this later
