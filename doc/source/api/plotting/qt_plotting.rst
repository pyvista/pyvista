PyVista and PyQt
----------------

Using ``PyQt`` you can embed the :class:`pyvista.Plotter` class within a ``PyQt`` widget to add PyVista to a ``Qt`` application within Python. You can also have a plot in a separate thread from the main python thread using a background plotter class. For more details, see `pyvistaqt <https://qtdocs.pyvista.org>`_.
