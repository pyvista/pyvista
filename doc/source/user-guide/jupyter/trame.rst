Trame Jupyter Backend for PyVista
---------------------------------

PyVista has the ability to display fully featured plots within a
Jupyter environment using `Trame <https://kitware.github.io/trame/index.html>`_.
We provide mechanisms to pair PyVista and Trame so that PyVista plotters
can be used in a web context with both server and client-side rendering.

The server-side rendering mode of the Trame backend works by streaming the
current render window to a canvas within Jupyter and then passing any user
actions from the canvas back to the VTK render window (this is done under
the hood by the ``vtkRemoteView`` in ``trame-vtk``.

For example, both sections of code will display an interactive canvas
within Jupyter:

.. code-block:: python

    import pyvista as pv
    sphere = pv.Sphere()

    # short example
    sphere.plot(jupyter_backend='trame')

    # long example
    plotter = pv.Plotter(notebook=True)
    plotter.add_mesh(sphere)
    plotter.show(jupyter_backend='trame')

For convenience, you can enable ``trame`` by default with:

.. code-block:: python

    import pyvista as pv
    pv.set_jupyter_backend('trame')


Trame Jupyter Modes
+++++++++++++++++++

The PyVista Trame jupyter backend provides three modes of operation (technically
as three separate backend choices):

* ``'trame'``: Uses a view that can switch between client- and server-rendering modes.
* ``'server'``: Uses a view that is purely server-rendering.
* ``'client'``: Uses a view that is purely client-rendering (generally safe without a virtual frame buffer)

You can choose your backend either by using :func:`set_jupyter_backend() <pyvista.set_jupyter_backend>`
or passing ``jupyter_backend`` on the :func:`show() <pyvista.Plotter.show>` call.

.. code-block:: python

    import pyvista as pv
    pv.set_jupyter_backend('client')

    pv.Cone().plot()


.. code-block:: python

    import pyvista as pv
    pv.set_jupyter_backend('trame')

    pl = pv.Plotter()
    pl.add_mesh(pv.Cone())
    pl.show(jupyter_backend='client')


Installation
++++++++++++

Using pip, you can set up your jupyter environment with:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install 'jupyterlab>=3' ipywidgets 'pyvista[all,trame]'


Remote Jupyter Host
+++++++++++++++++++

When using PyVista in Jupyter that is hosted remotely (docker, cloud JupyterHub,
binder, or otherwise), you will need to pair the Trame backend with either
``jupyter-server-proxy`` or ``trame-jupyter-extension``.


Jupyter Server Proxy
####################

`Jupyter Server Proxy <https://jupyter-server-proxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
lets you access the Trame server hosting the views of the PyVista plotters
alongside your notebook, and provide authenticated web access to them directly
through Jupyter.

To configure PyVista and Trame to work with ``jupyter-server-proxy`` in a remote
environment, you will need to set some options on the global PyVista theme:

* :py:attr:`pyvista.global_theme.trame.server_proxy_enabled
  <pyvista.plotting.themes._TrameConfig.server_proxy_enabled>`
* :py:attr:`pyvista.global_theme.trame.server_proxy_prefix
  <pyvista.plotting.themes._TrameConfig.server_proxy_prefix>`

The default for ``server_proxy_prefix`` is ``'/proxy/'`` and this should be sufficient
for most remote Jupyter environment and use within Docker.

This can also be set with an environment variable:

.. code-block:: bash

    export PYVISTA_TRAME_SERVER_PROXY_PREFIX='/proxy/'


The prefix will need to be modified for JupyterHub deployments.

On MyBinder, the ``JUPYTERHUB_SERVICE_PREFIX`` string often needs to prefix
``'/proxy/'``. This makes it so the prefix includes the users ID in the URL.
In PyVista, we automatically check for the presence of this variable and
prepend it to the ``server_proxy_prefix``.


Trame Jupyter Extension
#######################

`Trame Jupyter Extension <https://github.com/Kitware/trame-jupyter-extension/>`_
enables the trame server and client to communicate over the existing
`Jupyter Comms <https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/comms.html>`_
infrastructure, instead of creating a separate WebSocket connection.

Using this extension removes the need for a secondary web server and thus
``jupyter-server-proxy``.

Using pip, you can install the extension:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install trame_jupyter_extension

If using Jupyter Lab 3.x, make sure to install the version 1.x of the extension:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install "trame_jupyter_extension<2"

Once the extension is installed, you can select whether PyVista will use it by
setting the following flag to ``True`` or ``False``:

* :py:attr:`pyvista.global_theme.trame.jupyter_extension_enabled
  <pyvista.plotting.themes._TrameConfig.jupyter_extension_enabled>`


Setting Remote Jupyter Host with an Environment Variable
########################################################
You can set the Remote Jupyter Host manually with the flags discussed above,
but these need to be set every time the Jupyter kernel restarts. In some environments,
it may be more efficient to configure the Remote Jupyter Host with an environment variable.
If set, the value for ``PYVISTA_TRAME_JUPYTER_MODE`` will determine the values of
these two flags:

* :py:attr:`pyvista.global_theme.trame.server_proxy_enabled
  <pyvista.plotting.themes._TrameConfig.server_proxy_enabled>`
* :py:attr:`pyvista.global_theme.trame.jupyter_extension_enabled
  <pyvista.plotting.themes._TrameConfig.jupyter_extension_enabled>`

If set, the accepted values for ``PYVISTA_TRAME_JUPYTER_MODE`` include ``'extension'``, ``'proxy'``, and ``'native'``.
The following table shows how each accepted value will affect the two flags, as well as any precondition
that must be true for the value to be applicable. To meet these prerequisites,
review the sections above for installation instructions.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - ``PYVISTA_TRAME_JUPYTER_MODE``
     - Description
     - Condition
     - `server_proxy_enabled`
     - `jupyter_extension_enabled`

   * - "extension"
     - Use Trame Jupyter Extension
     - Extension must be available
     - False
     - True

   * - "proxy"
     - Use Jupyter Server Proxy
     - Proxy must be available
     - True
     - False

   * - "native"
     - Do not use Extension nor Proxy
     - None
     - False
     - False

Other Considerations
++++++++++++++++++++
It may be worth using GPU acceleration, see :ref:`gpu_off_screen`.

If you do not have GPU acceleration, alternatively, an offscreen version using OSMesa libraries and ``vtk-osmesa`` is available:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip uninstall vtk -y
    pip install --no-cache-dir --extra-index-url https://wheels.vtk.org vtk-osmesa
