This section contains resources to expand the usage of PyVista beyond
just running it from a Python console or IDE. For example, you can
package PyVista in a docker image and build VTK with EGL to enable
rich headless plotting on remote servers. You can also package
PyVista using `pyinstaller`_ to be used within a standalone
application.

See the :ref:`developer_notes` section for details on contributing
and how you can help develop PyVista.
