Installation
============
The only prerequisite for installing PyVista is Python itself. If you donâ€™t
have Python yet and want the simplest way to get started, we recommend you use
the `Anaconda Distribution <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_.

    .. grid-item-card:: Working with conda?
       :class-title: pyvista-card-title

       PyVista is available on `conda-forge
       <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pyvista>`_.

       .. code-block:: bash

          conda install -c conda-forge pyvista


    .. grid-item-card:: Prefer pip?
       :columns: auto
       :class-title: pyvista-card-title

       PyVista can be installed via pip from `PyPI
       <https://pypi.org/project/pyvista>`__.

       .. code-block:: bash

          pip install pyvista

   This code is used in the plot in the card.

.. pyvista-plot::
   :include-source: False
   :context:

   >>> bunny_cpos = [( 0.14826, 0.275729,  0.4215911),
   ...               (-0.01684, 0.110154, -0.0015369),
   ...               (-0.15446, 0.939031, -0.3071841)]

      Learn more about why we created PyVista as an interface to the
      Visualization Toolkit (VTK).

      .. code:: python

         import pyvista
         mesh = pyvista.read('bunny.stl')
         mesh.plot()

      .. pyvista-plot::
         :include-source: False
         :context:

         from pyvista import examples
         mesh = examples.download_bunny()
         mesh.plot(cpos=bunny_cpos, anti_aliasing='ssao')
