===========

PyVista is a powerful tool that researchers can harness to create compelling,
integrated visualizations of large datasets in an intuitive, Pythonic manner.

PyVista is used across science and engineering disciplines by a diverse
community to visualize data/models in 3D, generate publication-quality
illustrations, automate analysis workflows, and build custom applications
leveraging PyVista's 3D capabilities.

Here are a few open-source projects that leverage PyVista:


Engineering
-----------

* pyleecan_: Electrical engineering open-source software providing a user-friendly, unified, flexible simulation framework for the multiphysic design and optimization of electrical machines and drives.
* pymapdl_: Pythonic interface to Ansys MAPDL.
* pyprocar_: A Python library for electronic structure pre/post-processing.
* AeroSandbox_: Plug-and-play analysis tools for aerodynamics, propulsion, structures, trajectory design, and much more.
* Ptera_: Software for analyzing flapping-wing flight.
* PyViewFactor_: A tool for the numerical computation of radiation view factors, with applications in building physics, thermal comfort and heat transfer.


Geosciences
-----------

* GemPy_: 3D structural geological modeling software using PyVista for 3D visualization and interaction.
* gemgis_: Spatial data processing for geomodeling.
* gimli_: Geophysical inversion and modeling library.
* discretize_: Discretization tools for finite volume and inverse problems.
* SEGY-SAK_: SEGY Swiss Army Knife for Seismic Data.
* subsurface_: Core data exchange library for subsurface science and engineering.
* Flownet_: Data-Driven Reservoir Predictions.
* PVGeo_: Python package of VTK-based algorithms to analyze geoscientific data and models. PyVista is used to make the inputs and outputs of PVGeo's algorithms more accessible.
* omfvista_: 3D visualization for the Open Mining Format (omf). PyVista provides the foundation for this library's visualization.
