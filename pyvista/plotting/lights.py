    Parameters
    ----------
    position : list or tuple, optional
        The position of the light. The interpretation of the position
        depends on the type of the light and whether the light has a
        transformation matrix.  See also the :py:attr:`position`
        property.

    focal_point : list or tuple, optional
        The focal point of the light. The interpretation of the focal
        point depends on the type of the light and whether the light
        has a transformation matrix.  See also the
        :py:attr:`focal_point` property.

    color : string or 3-length sequence, optional
        The color of the light. The ambient, diffuse and specular
        colors will all be set to this color on creation.

    light_type : string or int, optional
        The type of the light. If a string, one of ``'headlight'``,
        ``'camera light'`` or ``'scene light'``. If an int, one of 1,
        2 or 3, respectively. The class constants ``Light.HEADLIGHT``,
        ``Light.CAMERA_LIGHT`` and ``Light.SCENE_LIGHT`` are also
        available, respectively.

            - A headlight is attached to the camera, looking at its
              focal point along the axis of the camera.

            - A camera light also moves with the camera, but it can
              occupy a general position with respect to it.

            - A scene light is stationary with respect to the scene,
              as it does not follow the camera. This is the default.

    intensity : float, optional
        The brightness of the light (between 0 and 1).

    positional : bool, optional
        Set if the light is positional.

        The default is a directional light, i.e. an infinitely distant
        point source. A positional light with a cone angle of at least
        90 degrees acts like a spherical point source. A positional
        light with a cone angle that is less than 90 degrees is known
        as a spotlight.

    cone_angle : float, optional
        Cone angle of a positional light in degrees.

    show_actor : bool, optional
        Show an actor for a spotlight that depicts the geometry of the
        beam.

    exponent : float, optional
        The exponent of the cosine used for spotlights. See also the
        :py:attr:`exponent` property.

    shadow_attenuation : float, optional
        The value of shadow attenuation.

        By default a light will be completely blocked when in shadow.
        By setting this value to less than 1.0 you can control how
        much light is attenuated when in shadow. Note that changing
        the :py:attr:`attenuation_values` of the light can make it pass
        through objects even if its shadow attenuation is 1.

    attenuation_values : sequence, optional
        Quadratic attenuation constants.

        The values are a 3-length sequence which specifies the constant,
        linear and quadratic constants in this order. These parameters
        only have an effect for positional lights.

    Examples
    --------
    Create a light at (10, 10, 10) and set its diffuse color to red.

    >>> import pyvista as pv

        With a spotlight (a positional light with cone angle less than
        90 degrees) the shape of the light beam within the light cone
        varies with the angle from the light's axis, and the variation
        of the intensity depends as the cosine of this angle raised to
        an exponent, which is 1 by default. Increasing the exponent
        makes the beam sharper (more focused around the axis),
        decreasing it spreads the beam out.

        Note that since the angular dependence defined by this
        property and the truncation performed by the
        :py:attr:`cone_angle` are independent, for spotlights with
        narrow beams (small :py:attr:`cone_angle`) it is harder to see
        the angular variation of the intensity, and a lot higher
        exponent might be necessary to visibly impact the angular
        distribution of the beam.

        Examples
        --------
        Plot three planes lit by three spotlights with exponents of 1,
        2 and 5.  The one with the lowest exponent has the broadest
        beam.

        is just a positional light, i.e. a spherical point source.

        Regarding the angular distribution of the light, the cone
        angle merely truncates the beam, the shape of which is defined
        by the :py:attr:`exponent`.  If the cone angle is at least 90
