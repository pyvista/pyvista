def axis_angle_rotation(axis, angle, point=None, deg=True):
    r"""Return a 4x4 matrix for rotation about any axis by given angle.

    Rotations around an axis that contains the origin can easily be
    computed using Rodrigues' rotation formula. The key quantity is
    the ``K`` cross product matrix for the unit vector ``n`` defining
    the axis of the rotation:

             /   0  -nz   ny \
        K =  |  nz    0  -nx |
             \ -ny   nx    0 /

    For a rotation angle ``phi`` around the vector ``n`` the rotation
    matrix is given by

        R = I + sin(phi) K  + (1 - cos(phi)) K^2

    where ``I`` is the 3-by-3 unit matrix and ``K^2`` denotes the matrix
    square of ``K``.

    If the rotation axis doesn't contain the origin, we have to first
    shift real space to transform the axis' ``p0`` reference point into
    the origin, then shift the points back after rotation:

        p' = R @ (p - p0) + p0 = R @ p + (p0 - R @ p0)

    This means that the rotation in general consists of a 3-by-3
    rotation matrix ``R``, and a translation given by
    ``b = p0 - R @ p0``. These can be encoded in a 4-by-4 transformation
    matrix by filling the 3-by-3 leading principal submatrix with ``R``,
    and filling the top 3 values in the last column with ``b``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    axis : 3-length sequence
        The direction vector of the rotation axis. It need not be a
        unit vector, but it must not be a zero vector.

    angle : float
        Angle of rotation around the axis. The angle is defined as a
        counterclockwise rotation when facing the normal vector of the
        rotation axis. Passed either in degrees or radians depending on
        the value of ``deg``.

    point : 3-length sequence, optional
        The origin of the rotation (a reference point through which the
        rotation axis passes). By default the rotation axis contains the
        origin.

    deg : bool, default: True
        Whether the angle is specified in degrees. ``False`` implies
        radians.

    Examples
    --------
    Generate a transformation matrix for rotation around a cube's body
    diagonal by 120 degrees.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from pyvista import transformations
    >>> trans = transformations.axis_angle_rotation([1, 1, 1], 120)

    Check that the transformation cycles the cube's three corners.

    >>> corners = np.array([
    ...     [1, 0, 0],
    ...     [0, 1, 0],
    ...     [0, 0, 1],
    ... ])
    >>> rotated = transformations.apply_transformation_to_points(trans, corners)
    >>> np.allclose(rotated, corners[[1, 2, 0], :])
    True

def reflection(normal, point=None):
    """Return a 4x4 matrix for reflection across a normal about a point.

    Projection to a unit vector ``n`` can be computed using the dyadic
    product (or outer product) ``P`` of ``n`` with itself, which is a
    3-by-3 symmetric matrix.

    Reflection across a plane that contains the origin amounts to
    reversing the components of real space points that are perpendicular
    to the reflection plane. This gives us the transformation ``R``
    acting on a point ``p`` as

        p' = R @ p = p - 2 P @ p = (I - 2 P) @ p

    so the reflection's transformation matrix is the unit matrix minus
    twice the dyadic product ``P``.

    If additionally we want to compute a reflection to a plane that does
    not contain the origin, we can we can first shift every point in
    real space by ``-p0`` (if ``p0`` is a point that lies on the plane)

        p' = R @ (p - p0) + p0 = R @ p + (p0 - R @ p0)

    This means that the reflection in general consists of a 3-by-3
    reflection matrix ``R``, and a translation given by
    ``b = p0 - R @ p0``. These can be encoded in a 4-by-4 transformation
    matrix by filling the 3-by-3 leading principal submatrix with ``R``,
    and filling the top 3 values in the last column with ``b``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    normal : 3-length sequence
        The normal vector of the reflection plane. It need not be a unit
        vector, but it must not be a zero vector.

    point : 3-length sequence, optional
        The origin of the reflection (a reference point through which
        the reflection plane passes). By default the reflection plane
        contains the origin.

    --------
    Generate a transformation matrix for reflection over the XZ plane.
