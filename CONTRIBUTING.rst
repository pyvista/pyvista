Contributing
============

We absolutely welcome contributions and we hope that this guide will
facilitate an understanding of the PyVista code repository. It is
important to note that the PyVista software package is maintained on a
volunteer basis and thus we need to foster a community that can support
user questions and develop new features to make this software a useful
tool for all users.

This page is dedicated to outline where you should start with your
question, concern, feature request, or desire to contribute.

Being Respectful
----------------

Please demonstrate empathy and kindness toward other people, other software,
and the communities who have worked diligently to build (un)related tools.

Please do not talk down in Pull Requests, Issues, or otherwise in a way that
portrays other people or their works in a negative light.

Cloning the Source Repository
-----------------------------

You can clone the source repository from
`<https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista>`_ and install the latest version by
running:

.. code:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista.git
   cd pyvista
   python -m pip install -e .

Questions

software usage, please create a discussion in the
`Discussions <https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista/discussions>`_
repository where the community can collectively address your questions.

You are also welcome to join us on `Slack <http://slack.pyvista.org>`_,
but Slack should be reserved for ad hoc conversations and community engagement
rather than technical discussions.

For critical, high-level project support and engagement, please email
info@pyvista.org - but please do not use this email for technical support.

For all technical conversations, you are welcome to create an issue on the
`Discussions page <https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista/discussions>`_
which we will address promptly. Through posting on the Discussions page,
your question can be addressed by community members with the needed
expertise and the information gained will remain available for other
users to find.

Reporting Bugs
--------------

If you stumble across any bugs, crashes, or concerning quirks while
using code distributed here, please report it on the `issues
page <https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista/issues>`_ with an appropriate
label so we can promptly address it. When reporting an issue, please be
overly descriptive so that we may reproduce it. Whenever possible,
please provide tracebacks, screenshots, and sample files to help us
address the issue.

Feature Requests
----------------

We encourage users to submit ideas for improvements to PyVista code
base. Please create an issue on the `issues
page <https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista/issues>`_ with a *Feature
Request* label to suggest an improvement. Please use a descriptive title
and provide ample background information to help the community implement
that functionality. For example, if you would like a reader for a
specific file format, please provide a link to documentation of that
file format and possibly provide some sample files with screenshots to
work with. We will use the issue thread as a place to discuss and
provide feedback.

Contributing New Code
---------------------

If you have an idea for how to improve PyVista, please first create an
issue as a feature request which we can use as a discussion thread to
work through how to implement the contribution.

Once you are ready to start coding and develop for PyVista, please see
the `Development Practices <#development-practices>`_ section for more
details.

Licensing
---------

All contributed code will be licensed under The MIT License found in the
repository. If you did not write the code yourself, it is your
responsibility to ensure that the existing license is compatible and
included in the contributed files or you can obtain permission from the
original author to relicense the code.

--------------

Development Practices
---------------------

This section provides a guide to how we conduct development in the
PyVista repository. Please follow the practices outlined here when
contributing directly to this repository.

Guidelines
~~~~~~~~~~

Through direct access to the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) via direct
array access and intuitive Python properties, we hope to make the entire
VTK library easily accessible to researchers of all disciplines. To
further PyVista towards being a valuable Python interface to VTK, we
need your help to make it even better.

If you want to add one or two interesting analysis algorithms as
filters, implement a new plotting routine, or just fix 1-2 typos - your
efforts are welcome.

There are three general coding paradigms that we believe in:

1. **Make it intuitive**. PyVistaâ€™s goal is to create an intuitive and
   easy to use interface back to the VTK library. Any new features
   should have intuitive naming conventions and explicit keyword
   arguments for users to make the bulk of the library accessible to
   novice users.

2. **Document everything**. At the least, include a docstring for any
   method or class added. Do not describe what you are doing but why you
   are doing it and provide a simple example for the new features.

3. **Keep it tested**. We aim for a high test coverage. See testing for
   more details.

There are two important copyright guidelines:

4. Please do not include any data sets for which a license is not
   available or commercial use is prohibited. Those can undermine the
   license of the whole projects.

5. Do not use code snippets for which a license is not available
   (for example from Stack Overflow) or commercial use is prohibited. Those can
   undermine the license of the whole projects.

Please also take a look at our `Code of
Conduct <https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`_.

Contributing to PyVista through GitHub
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To submit new code to pyvista, first fork the `pyvista GitHub
Repository <https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista>`_ and then clone the forked
repository to your computer. Then, create a new branch based on the
`Branch Naming Conventions Section <#branch-naming-conventions>`_ in
your local repository.

Next, add your new feature and commit it locally. Be sure to commit
frequently as it is often helpful to revert to past commits, especially
if your change is complex. Also, be sure to test often. See the `Testing
Section <#testing>`_ below for automating testing.

When you are ready to submit your code, create a pull request by
following the steps in the `Creating a New Pull Request
section <#creating-a-new-pull-request>`_.

Coding Style
^^^^^^^^^^^^

We adhere to `PEP 8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_
wherever possible, except that line widths are permitted to go beyond 79
characters to a max of 99 characters for code. This should tend to be
the exception rather than the norm. A uniform code style is enforced
by `black <https://github.com/psf/black>`_ to prevent energy wasted on
style disagreements.

As for docstrings, follow the guidelines specified in `PEP 8 Maximum
Line
Length <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#maximum-line-length>`_
of limiting docstrings to 72 characters per line. This follows the
directive:

   Some teams strongly prefer a longer line length. For code maintained
   exclusively or primarily by a team that can reach agreement on this
   issue, it is okay to increase the line length limit up to 99
   characters, provided that comments and docstrings are still wrapped
   at 72 characters.

Outside of PEP 8, when coding please consider `PEP 20 - The Zen of
Python <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/>`_. When in doubt:

.. code:: python

   import this

PyVista uses `pre-commit`_ to enforce PEP8 and other styles
automatically. Please see the `Style Checking section <#style-checking>`_ for
further details.

Documentation Style
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PyVista follows the `Google Developer Documentation Style
<https://developers.google.com/style>`_ with the following exceptions:

- Allow first person pronouns. These pronouns (for example, "We") refer to
  "PyVista Developers", which can be anyone who contributes to PyVista.
- Future tense is permitted.

These rules are enforced for all text files (for example, ``*.md``, ``*.rst``)
and partially enforced for Python source files.

These rules are enforced through the use of `Vale <https://vale.sh/>`_ via our
GitHub Actions, and you can run Vale locally with:

.. code::

   pip install vale
   vale --config doc/.vale.ini doc pyvista examples ./*.rst --glob='!*{_build,AUTHORS.rst}*'

If you are on Linux or macOS, you can run:

.. code::

   make docstyle


Docstrings
^^^^^^^^^^

PyVista uses Python docstrings to create reference documentation for our Python
APIs. Docstrings are read by developers, interactive Python users, and readers
of our online documentation. This section describes how to write these docstrings
for PyVista.

PyVista follows the ``numpydoc`` style for its docstrings. Please follow the
`numpydoc Style Guide`_ in all ways except for the following:

* Be sure to describe all ``Parameters`` and ``Returns`` for all public
  methods.
* We strongly encourage you to add an example section. PyVista is a visual
  library, so adding examples that show a plot will really help users figure
  out what individual methods do.
* With optional parameters, use ``default: <value>`` instead of ``optional``
  when the parameter has a default value instead of ``None``.

Sample docstring follows:

.. code:: python

    def slice_x(self, x=None, generate_triangles=False):
        """Create an orthogonal slice through the dataset in the X direction.

        Parameters
        ----------
        x : float, optional
            The X location of the YZ slice. By default this will be the X center
            of the dataset.

        generate_triangles : bool, default: False
            If this is enabled, the output will be all triangles. Otherwise the
            output will consist of the intersection polygons.

        Returns
        -------
        pyvista.PolyData
            Sliced dataset.

        Examples
        --------
        Slice the random hills dataset with one orthogonal plane.

        >>> from pyvista import examples
        >>> hills = examples.load_random_hills()
        >>> slices = hills.slice_x(5, generate_triangles=False)
        >>> slices.plot(line_width=5)

        See :ref:`slice_example` for more examples using this filter.

        """

        pass  # implementation goes here

Note the following:

* The parameter definition of ``generate_triangles`` uses ``default: False``,
  and does not include the default in the docstring's "description" section.
* There is a newline between each parameter. This is different than
  ``numpydoc``'s documentation where there are no empty lines between parameter
  docstrings.
* This docstring also contains a returns section and an examples section.
* The returns section does not include the parameter name if the function has
  a single return value. Multiple return values (not shown) should have
  descriptive parameter names for each returned value, in the same format as
  the input parameters.
* The examples section references the "full example" in the gallery if it
  exists.

These standards will be enforced using ``pre-commit`` using
``numpydoc-validate``, with errors being reported as:

.. code-block:: text

   +-----------------+--------------------------+---------+-------------------------------------------------+
   | file            | item                     | check   | description                                     |
   +=================+==========================+=========+=================================================+
   | cells.py:85     | cells.create_mixed_cells | RT05    | Return value description should finish with "." |
   +-----------------+--------------------------+---------+-------------------------------------------------+
   | cells.py:85     | cells.create_mixed_cells | RT05    | Return value description should finish with "." |
   +-----------------+--------------------------+---------+-------------------------------------------------+
   | features.py:250 | features.merge           | PR09    | Parameter "datasets" description should finish  |
   |                 |                          |         | with "."                                        |
   +-----------------+--------------------------+---------+-------------------------------------------------+

If for whatever reason you feel that your function should have an exception to
any of the rules, add an exception to the function either in the
``[tool.numpydoc_validation]`` section in ``pyproject.toml`` or add an inline
comment to exclude a certain check. For example, we do not enforce
documentation strings for setters and skip the GL08 check.

.. code:: python

    @strips.setter
    def strips(self, strips):  # numpydoc ignore=GL08
        if isinstance(strips, CellArray):
            self.SetStrips(strips)
        else:
            self.SetStrips(CellArray(strips))

See the available validation checks in `numpydoc Validation
<https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/validation.html>`_.


Deprecating Features or other Backwards-Breaking Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When implementing backwards-breaking changes within PyVista, care must be taken
to give users the chance to adjust to any new changes. Any non-backwards
compatible modifications should proceed through the following steps:

#. Retain the old behavior and issue a ``PyVistaDeprecationWarning`` indicating
   the new interface you should use.
#. Retain the old behavior but raise a ``pyvista.core.errors.DeprecationError``
   indicating the new interface you must use.
#. Remove the old behavior.

Whenever possible, PyVista developers should seek to have at least three minor
versions of backwards compatibility to give users the ability to update their
software and scripts.

Here's an example of a soft deprecation of a function. Note the usage of both
the ``PyVistaDeprecationWarning`` warning and the ``.. deprecated`` Sphinx
directive.

.. code:: python

    def addition(a, b):
        """Add two numbers.

        .. deprecated:: 0.37.0
           Since PyVista 0.37.0, you can use :func:`pyvista.add` instead.

        Parameters
        ----------
        a : float
            First term to add.

        b : float
            Second term to add.

        Returns
        -------
        float
            Sum of the two inputs.

        """
        # deprecated 0.37.0, convert to error in 0.40.0, remove 0.41.0
        PyVistaDeprecationWarning(
            '`addition` has been deprecated. Use pyvista.add instead'
        )
        add(a, b)


    def add(a, b):
        """Add two numbers."""

        pass  # implementation goes here

In the above code example, note how a comment is made to convert to an error in
three minor releases and completely remove in the following minor release. For
significant changes, this can be made longer, and for trivial ones this can be
kept short.

When adding an additional parameter to an existing method or function, you are
encouraged to use the ``.. versionadded`` sphinx directive. For example:

.. code:: python

    def Cube(clean=True):
        """Create a cube.

        Parameters
        ----------
        clean : bool, default: True
            Whether to clean the raw points of the mesh.

            .. versionadded:: 0.33.0
        """


Branch Naming Conventions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To streamline development, we have the following requirements for naming
branches. These requirements help the core developers know what kind of
changes any given branch is introducing before looking at the code.

-  ``fix/``, ``patch/`` and ``bug/``: any bug fixes, patches, or experimental changes that are
   minor
-  ``feat/``: any changes that introduce a new feature or significant
   addition
-  ``junk/``: for any experimental changes that can be deleted if gone
   stale
-  ``maint/``: for general maintenance of the repository or CI routines
-  ``doc/``: for any changes only pertaining to documentation
-  ``no-ci/``: for low impact activity that should NOT trigger the CI
   routines
-  ``testing/``: improvements or changes to testing
-  ``release/``: releases (see below)
-  ``breaking-change/``: Changes that break backward compatibility

Testing
^^^^^^^

After making changes, please test changes locally before creating a pull
request. The following tests will be executed after any commit or pull
request, so we ask that you perform the following sequence locally to
track down any new issues from your changes.

To run our comprehensive suite of unit tests, install all the
dependencies listed in ``requirements_test.txt`` and ``requirements_docs.txt``:

.. code:: bash

   pip install -r requirements_test.txt
   pip install -r requirements_docs.txt

Then, if you have everything installed, you can run the various test
suites.

Using Gitpod Workspace
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A gitpod workspace is available for a quick start development
environment. To start a workspace from the main branch of pyvista, go
to `<https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista>`_. See
`Gitpod Getting Started
<https://www.gitpod.io/docs/getting-started>`_ for more details.

The workspace has vnc capability through the browser for
interactive plotting. The workspace also has the ability to view the
documentation with a live-viewer. Hit the ``Go Live`` button
and browse to ``doc/_build/html``. The workspace also preloads
pre-commit environments and installs requirements.

Unit Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Run the primary test suite and generate coverage report:

.. code:: bash

   python -m pytest -v --cov pyvista

Unit testing can take some time, if you wish to speed it up, set the
number of processors with the ``-n`` flag. This uses ``pytest-xdist`` to
leverage multiple processes. Example usage:

.. code:: bash

   python -m pytest -n <NUMCORE> --cov pyvista

Documentation Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Run all code examples in the docstrings with:

.. code:: bash

   python -m pytest -v --doctest-modules pyvista

Style Checking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
PyVista follows PEP8 standard as outlined in the `Coding Style section
<#coding-style>`_ and implements style checking using `pre-commit`_.

To ensure your code meets minimum code styling standards, run::

  pip install pre-commit
  pre-commit run --all-files

If you have issues related to ``setuptools`` when installing ``pre-commit``, see
`pre-commit Issue #2178 comment <https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit/issues/2178#issuecomment-1002163763>`_
for a potential resolution.

You can also install this as a pre-commit hook by running::

  pre-commit install

This way, it's not possible for you to push code that fails the style
checks. For example, each commit automatically checks that you meet the style
requirements::

  $ pre-commit install
  $ git commit -m "added my cool feature"
  black....................................................................Passed
  isort....................................................................Passed
  flake8...................................................................Passed
  codespell................................................................Passed

The actual installation of the environment happens before the first commit
following ``pre-commit install``. This will take a bit longer, but subsequent
commits will only trigger the actual style checks.

Even if you are not in a situation where you are not performing or able to
perform the above tasks, you can comment `pre-commit.ci autofix` on a pull
request to manually trigger auto-fixing.

Notes Regarding Image Regression Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since PyVista is primarily a plotting module, itâ€™s imperative we
actually check the images that we generate in some sort of regression
testing. In practice, this ends up being quite a bit of work because:

-  OpenGL software vs. hardware rending causes slightly different images
   to be rendered.
-  We want our CI (which uses a virtual frame buffer) to match our
   desktop images (uses hardware acceleration).
-  Different OSes render different images.

As each platform and environment renders different slightly images
relative to Linux (which these images were built from), so running these
tests across all OSes isnâ€™t optimal. We need to know if
something fundamental changed with our plotting without actually looking
at the plots (like the docs at dev.pyvista.com)

Based on these points, image regression testing only occurs on Linux CI,
and multi-sampling is disabled as that seems to be one of the biggest
difference between software and hardware based rendering.

Image cache is stored here as ``./tests/plotting/image_cache``.

Image resolution is kept low at 400x400 as we donâ€™t want to pollute git
with large images. Small variations between versions and environments
are to be expected, so error < ``IMAGE_REGRESSION_ERROR`` is allowable
(and will be logged as a warning) while values over that amount will
trigger an error.

There are two mechanisms within ``pytest`` to control image regression
testing, ``--reset_image_cache`` and ``--ignore_image_cache``. For
example:

.. code:: bash

       pytest tests/plotting --reset_image_cache

Running ``--reset_image_cache`` creates a new image for each test in
``tests/plotting/test_plotting.py`` and is not recommended except for
testing or for potentially a major or minor release. You can use
``--ignore_image_cache`` if youâ€™re running on Linux and want to
temporarily ignore regression testing. Realize that regression testing
will still occur on our CI testing.

Images are currently only cached from tests in
``tests/plotting/test_plotting.py``. By default, any test that uses
``Plotter.show`` will cache images automatically. To skip image caching,
the ``verify_image_cache`` fixture can be utilized:

.. code:: python


       def test_add_background_image_not_global(verify_image_cache):
           verify_image_cache.skip = True  # Turn off caching
           plotter = pyvista.Plotter()
           plotter.add_mesh(sphere)
           plotter.show()
           # Turn on caching for further plotting
           verify_image_cache.skip = False
           ...

This ensures that immediately before the plotter is closed, the current
render window will be verified against the image in CI. If no image
exists, be sure to add the resulting image with

.. code:: bash

    git add tests/plotting/image_cache/*

During unit testing, if you get image regression failures and would like to
compare the images generated locally to the regression test suite, allow
`pytest-pyvista`_ to write all new
generated images to a local directory using the ``--generated_image_dir`` flag.

.. _pytest-pyvista: https://pytest.pyvista.org/

For example, the following writes all images generated by ``pytest`` to
``debug_images/`` for any tests in ``tests/plotting`` whose function name has
``volume`` in it.

.. code:: bash

   pytest tests/plotting/ -k volume --generated_image_dir debug_images

See `pytest-pyvista`_ for more details.

Building the Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Build the documentation on Linux or Mac OS with:

.. code:: bash

   make -C doc html

Build the documentation on Windows with:

.. code:: winbatch

   cd doc
   python -msphinx -M html source _build
   python -msphinx -M html . _build

The generated documentation can be found in the ``doc/_build/html``
directory.

The first time you build the documentation locally will take a while as all the
examples need to be built. After the first build, the documentation should take
a fraction of the time.

Clearing the Local Build
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you need to clear the locally built documentation, run:

.. code:: bash

   make -C doc clean

This will clear out everything, including the examples gallery. If you only
want to clear everything except the gallery examples, run:

.. code:: bash

   make -C doc clean-except-examples

This will clear out the cache without forcing you to rebuild all the examples.


Parallel Documentation Build
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can improve your documentation build time on Linux and Mac OS with:

.. code:: bash

   make -C doc phtml

This effectively invokes ``SPHINXOPTS=-j`` and can be especially useful for
multi-core computers.



Contributing to the Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Documentation for PyVista is generated from three sources:

- Docstrings from the classes, functions, and modules of ``pyvista`` using
  `sphinx.ext.autodoc
  <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html>`_.
- Restructured test from ``doc/``
- Gallery examples from ``examples/``

General usage and API descriptions should be placed within ``doc/api`` and
the docstrings. Full gallery examples should be placed in ``examples``.


Adding a New Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
PyVista's examples come in two formats: basic code snippets demonstrating the
functionality of an individual method or a full gallery example displaying one
or more concepts. Small code samples and snippets are contained in the
``doc/api`` directory or within our documentation strings, while the full
gallery examples, meant to be run as individual downloadable scripts, are
contained in the ``examples`` directory at the root of this repository.

To add a fully fledged, standalone example, add your example to the
``examples`` directory in the root directory of the `PyVista Repository
<https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista/>`_ within one of the applicable
subdirectories. Should none of the existing directories match the category of
your example, create a new directory with a ``README.txt`` describing the new
category. Additionally, as these examples are built using the sphinx gallery
extension, follow coding guidelines as established by `Sphinx-Gallery
<https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/stable/index.html>`_.

For more details see :ref:`add_example_example`.


Add a New Example File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you have a dataset that you need for your gallery example, add it to
`pyvista/vtk-data <https://github.com/pyvista/vtk-data/>`_ and follow the
directions there. You will then need to add a new function to download the
dataset ``pyvista/examples/downloads.py``. This might be as easy as:

.. code:: python

   def download_my_dataset(load=True):
       """Download my new dataset."""
       return _download_and_read('mydata/my_new_dataset.vtk', load=load)


Which enables:

.. code::

   >>> from pyvista import examples
   >>> dataset = examples.download_my_dataset()


Creating a New Pull Request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have tested your branch locally, create a pull request on
`pyvista GitHub <https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista>`_ while merging to
main. This will automatically run continuous integration (CI) testing
and verify your changes will work across several platforms.

To ensure someone else reviews your code, at least one other member of
the pyvista contributors group must review and verify your code meets
our communityâ€™s standards. Once approved, if you have write permission
you may merge the branch. If you donâ€™t have write permission, the
reviewer or someone else with write permission will merge the branch and
delete the PR branch.

Since it may be necessary to merge your branch with the current release
branch (see below), please do not delete your branch if it is a ``fix/``
branch.

Branching Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This project has a branching model that enables rapid development of
features without sacrificing stability, and closely follows the `Trunk
Based Development <https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/>`_ approach.

The main features of our branching model are:

-  The ``main`` branch is the main development branch. All features,
   patches, and other branches should be merged here. While all PRs
   should pass all applicable CI checks, this branch may be functionally
   unstable as changes might have introduced unintended side-effects or
   bugs that were not caught through unit testing.
-  There will be one or many ``release/`` branches based on minor
   releases (for example ``release/0.24``) which contain a stable
   version of the code base that is also reflected on PyPI/. Hotfixes
   from ``fix/`` branches should be merged both to main and to these
   branches. When necessary to create a new patch release these release
   branches will have their ``pyvista/_version.py`` updated and be tagged
   with a semantic version (for example ``v0.24.1``). This triggers CI
   to push to PyPI, and allow us to rapidly push hotfixes for past
   versions of ``pyvista`` without having to worry about untested
   features.
-  When a minor release candidate is ready, a new ``release`` branch
   will be created from ``main`` with the next incremented minor version
   (for example ``release/0.25``), which will be thoroughly tested. When deemed
   stable, the release branch will be tagged with the version
   (``v0.25.0`` in this case), and if necessary merged with main if any
   changes were pushed to it. Feature development then continues on
   ``main`` and any hotfixes will now be merged with this release. Older
   release branches should not be deleted so they can be patched as
   needed.

Minor Release Steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Minor releases are feature and bug releases that improve the
functionality and stability of ``pyvista``. Before a minor release is
created the following will occur:

1.  Create a new branch from the ``main`` branch with name
    ``release/MAJOR.MINOR`` (for example ``release/0.25``).

2.  Update the development version numbers in ``pyvista/_version.py``
    and commit it (for example ``0, 26, 'dev0'``). Push the branch to GitHub
    and create a new PR for this release that merges it to main.
    Development to main should be limited at this point while effort
    is focused on the release.

3.  Locally run all tests as outlined in the `Testing
    Section <#testing>`_ and ensure all are passing.

4.  Locally test and build the documentation with link checking to make
    sure no links are outdated. Be sure to run ``make clean`` to ensure
    no results are cached.

    .. code:: bash

       cd doc
       make clean  # deletes the sphinx-gallery cache
       make doctest-modules
       make html -b linkcheck

5.  After building the documentation, open the local build and examine
    the examples gallery for any obvious issues.

6.  It is now the responsibility of the ``pyvista`` community to
    functionally test the new release. It is best to locally install
    this branch and use it in production. Any bugs identified should
    have their hotfixes pushed to this release branch.

7.  When the branch is deemed as stable for public release, the PR will
    be merged to main. After update the version number in
    ``release/MAJOR.MINOR`` branch, the ``release/MAJOR.MINOR`` branch
    will be tagged with a ``vMAJOR.MINOR.0`` release. The release branch
    will not be deleted. Tag the release with:

    .. code:: bash

       git tag v$(python -c "import pyvista as pv; print(pv.__version__)")

8.  Please check again that the tag has been created correctly and push the tag.

    .. code:: bash

       git push origin --tags

9.  Create a list of all changes for the release. It is often helpful to
    leverage `GitHubâ€™s compare
    feature <https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista/compare>`_ to see the
    differences from the last tag and the ``main`` branch. Be sure to
    acknowledge new contributors by their GitHub username and place
    mentions where appropriate if a specific contributor is to thank for
    a new feature.

10. Place your release notes from previous step in the description for `the new
    release on
    GitHub <https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista/releases/new>`_.

11. Go grab a beer/coffee/water and wait for
    `@regro-cf-autotick-bot <https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts>`_
    to open a pull request on the conda-forge `PyVista
    feedstock <https://github.com/conda-forge/pyvista-feedstock>`_.
    Merge that pull request.

12. Announce the new release in the Discussions page and
    celebrate.

Patch Release Steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Patch releases are for critical and important bugfixes that can not or
should not wait until a minor release. The steps for a patch release

1. Push the necessary bugfix(es) to the applicable release branch. This
   will generally be the latest release branch (for example ``release/0.25``).

2. Update ``pyvista/_version.py`` with the next patch increment (for example
   ``v0.25.1``), commit it, and open a PR that merge with the release
   branch. This gives the ``pyvista`` community a chance to validate and
   approve the bugfix release. Any additional hotfixes should be outside
   of this PR.

3. When approved, merge with the release branch, but not ``main`` as
   there is no reason to increment the version of the ``main`` branch.
   Then create a tag from the release branch with the applicable version
   number (see above for the correct steps).

4. If deemed necessary, create a release notes page. Also, open the PR
   from conda and follow the directions in step 10 in the minor release
   section.
