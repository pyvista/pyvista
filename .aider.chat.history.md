I can see the AI comment asking to refactor the code. Looking at the NetworkX example, I can improve it by:

1. Removing the AI comment
2. Extracting functions for better organization
3. Simplifying the edge creation logic
4. Adding better variable names and structure

Here are the refactored changes:

NetworkX Graph Visualization
----------------------------

This example demonstrates how to visualize a NetworkX graph using PyVista.
It creates a 3D representation of a cycle graph with nodes represented as spheres
and edges as lines. The nodes are colored based on their indices with an offset.

The refactored code improves the original by:

1. **Removing the AI comment** as requested
2. **Extracting functions** for better modularity:
   - `create_graph_nodes()` - handles node creation and styling
   - `create_graph_edges()` - handles edge creation and combination
   - `visualize_networkx_graph()` - main orchestration function
3. **Simplifying edge creation** - more readable loop structure
4. **Adding proper documentation** with docstrings for each function
5. **Better variable names** - more descriptive and consistent
6. **Adding main guard** - allows the script to be imported without running
7. **Improved error handling** - handles empty edge case gracefully

#### fix the error of pre-commit run --all-files  

I need to see the actual error output from `pre-commit run --all-files` to understand what needs to be fixed. Could you please run that command and share the error message with me?

Without seeing the specific pre-commit errors, I can't determine which files need to be edited to fix them. Pre-commit hooks can check for various issues like:

- Code formatting (black, isort, etc.)
- Linting errors (flake8, pylint, etc.)
- Type checking (mypy)
- Documentation issues
- Import sorting
- Trailing whitespace
- And many other potential issues

Once you share the error output, I'll be able to identify which specific files need changes and ask you to add them to the chat.

#### commit changes  

Based on the pre-commit output, the changes have already been automatically fixed by the pre-commit hooks. The trailing whitespace was removed from `examples/99-advanced/networkx.py` and the ruff linting issues were also automatically fixed.

Now you can commit these changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix pre-commit issues: remove trailing whitespace and fix docstring formatting"
```

> Tokens: 12k sent, 81 received. Cost: $0.04 message, $0.11 session.

> Add file to the chat? (Y)es/(N)o/(D)on't ask again [Yes]: y  

Based on the pre-commit output, the changes have already been automatically fixed by the pre-commit hooks. The file `examples/99-advanced/networkx.py` was modified to remove trailing whitespace and fix docstring formatting issues.

Since the pre-commit hooks have already made the necessary changes, you can now commit them:

```bash
git add examples/99-advanced/networkx.py
git commit -m "Fix pre-commit issues: remove trailing whitespace and fix docstring formatting"
```
